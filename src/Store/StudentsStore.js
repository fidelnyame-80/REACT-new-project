// We are creating a GLOBAL store.
// This store replaces local state (useState) that was previously in App.jsx.

  // 🆕 NEW (GLOBAL STATE):
  // This replaces: const [students, setStudents] = useState([]);
  // It holds all students globally so any component can access it.

  // 🆕 NEW (STORE ACTION):
  // This function replaces setStudents(prev => [...prev, student])
  // It is used to ADD a new student to the global store.
  addStudents: (student) =>
    // 🔁 SAME UPDATE PATTERN AS BEFORE:

  // 🆕 NEW (STORE ACTION — DELETE):
  // This function replaces the delete logic we had in StudentsList
  // It receives ONLY the student id and removes that student
  deleteStudent: (id) =>

  // This function replaces the update logic we had in StudentsList
  // It receives:
  // 1. the student id
  // 2. the updated data (name, course)
  updateStudent: (id, updatedData) =>
    set((state) => ({
      // 🔁 SAME UPDATE LOGIC AS LOCAL STATE:

// 🆕 EXPORTING THE STORE:
// This allows any component to access or update students using this hook.
